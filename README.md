# Group PROJECT 
About Go Baby Go: After a lab meeting in a local toy store led by founder Dr. Cole Galloway, Go Baby Go began in 2012 as a grassroots program to fulfill a need for an affordable, socially inviting, and customizable early powered mobility option for young children with disabilities, through making simple safety and accessibility modifications to commercially available, battery-powered toy ride-on cars. It is now an international movement, with Go Baby Go team members conducting mobility and developmental research, running car modification instructional workshops for families, therapists, and community volunteers, and advocating for the recognition of self-directed mobility as a basic human right. You can learn more by visiting the Go Baby Go website, and our Seattle Go Baby Go Facebook page.

Challenge: Go Baby Go cars provide a fun and inviting way for young children with and without disabilities to move around, play with their peers, and explore their environment. Usually, the child activates the car by pressing a large, easy to press button, positioned on top of the steering wheel. In many cases, however, steering the car on his or her own is difficult for the child, due to differences in hand and arm coordination, range of motion, and/or strength. Caregivers, siblings, or therapists often have to turn the steering wheel for the child, and to do this requires bending over a moving vehicle, which is uncomfortable to do for long periods of time, and decreases the independence that can be enjoyed by the child. This design challenge involves creating child-led steering solutions for a Frozen™ Go Baby Go modified ride-on car, so a child may activate and steer the ride-on car independently, regardless of upper extremity ability. These solutions should be safe, affordable, replicable for other car models and other children, and allow for improved access of both child and caregiver to enjoy their Go Baby Go car.
